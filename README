Modules:

chunk.py            Original python module for handling RIFF chunks with extensions for handling RF64
wave_bwf_rf64.py    Extension of original wave.py module with BWF handling added (bext, chna, axml, md5 and levl chunks).

This package will give you the ability to work with both BWF and RF64 compatible wav-files in python.

The addition of the md5 and levl chunks and the RF64 support was implemented by Tormod Værvågen of NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation).

As of v 1.0.6 we no longer support python version lower than 3.5. Use 1.0.5 for py2 support. We will not backport new features.

To setup distribution:
> python setup.py sdist
this will produce a 'dist' directory containing the gunziped file that can be released or installed.

To install modules:
In 'dist':
> tar -xzf wave_bwf_rf64-1.0.6.tar.gz
> cd wave_bwf-1.0
> sudo python setup.py install

Or, which would be better:
> pip install wave_bwf_rf64-1.0.6.tar.gz
